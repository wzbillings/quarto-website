> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

This famous quote by statistician George Box [@box1976] is a pretty good
summary of the viewpoint that I've come to call "statistical nihilism." There's
a lot of ink spilled about the frequentist/bayesian testing/estimation
parametric/nonparametric divide. Fortunately I'm able to settle that: your
favorite statistical paradigm, in particular, is fake and wrong. And just in
case you were wondering, it's not "less wrong" than any other viewpoint. It's
statistics, so it's wrong. Sometimes it's useful, and perhaps your pet method
is quite often very useful, but it's still wrong and I'm tired of pretending
that it isn't.

There's no such thing as a correct model or a correct method or a real estimate
or unbiased sample or anything like that. Statistics doesn't even exist in
real life and we should stop pretending that it does. I don't think there's a
particularly eloquent way for me to convey this (I'm certainly not the best
person to write this post), but the main takeaway I want anyone who reads this
to have is that **all statistics are made up.** Even collecting data or
making observations is only sort of real, but I'm not a philosopher so I won't
get into perception or whatever here.

Let's start with a simple example: the mean. If you go on an apple-picking
adventure and all of your friends come and you all pick apples, you can count
the number of apples that each of your friends picked. I'm not trying to argue
whether or not those counts are real -- it depends on whether you think math
is real. (I personally think that there is certainly some fundamental concept of
quantity that *is* real, because there is some perceivable amount of apples
that exists independently of our invented human concept of numbers, but at the
tail end of this debate you get back to the philosophy of perception and what
does it even mean to say something exists and two things are different and
that isn't what I'm really interested in here.) You can even calculate the
average number of apples that each person has. And you can then proceed to
say something glib like "if we equally divided the apples amount each of us,
the number of apples we would each get is this number that I calculated." Which
is true in the sense of that physical application. But that calculated number
is not a physical thing that exists -- it is a mathematical concept that tells
you about a physical problem you want to solve.
