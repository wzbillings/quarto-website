This checklist is 100% adapted from a [much better blog post by Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2024-02-19_beginner-quarto-netlify/).
This is a condensed version that is designed to print on ~1 (maybe front/back)
letter sized page.

# Steps for making a Quarto website with Netlify.

1. Install R and RStudio, update Quarto.
    1. R download link: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
    1. RStudio download link: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
    1. Quarto download link: [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
1. Open RStudio, and use the dialog menu to create a new project in a new
directory. Choose the "Quarto Website" project type. Optionally, check the
"use visual editor" option.
1. (Optional) render the website for the first time.
1. Edit the home page (`index.qmd`). Specify the title and homepage contents.
1. Edit the about page (`about.qmd`), using [a template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates) from
the quarto docs. Add an image if you have one.
1. Add a new page called "Projects" along with a directory, and set it up as a [listing page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html).
1. Add a new test project to the listing.
1. Edit the listing `_metadata.yml` so that code pages get frozen.
1. Update `_quarto.yml` to show the listing page, also talk about updating
the website theme. See themes [here](https://bootswatch.com/).
1. Make sure everything renders.
1. Create an account on [netlify](https://netlify.com/) if you don't have one,
then create a new netlify site. Upload the entire `_site` folder to Netlify.
1. In site configuration, set up the site name. You can also add a custom
domain name here if you want to pay for one.
1. Whenever you want to update your website, simply render it again, and upload
the `_site` folder to your website.
