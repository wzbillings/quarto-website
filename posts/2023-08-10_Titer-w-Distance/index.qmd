  So I work with a lot of immunological titer data, particularly HAI titers
  for flu. And I've recently needed to work out how to do some simulations. So
  this post will cover the generative model I've developed and show some
  examples, while hopefully explaining each step in a way. Mostly so my adviser
  can tell me what he thinks I did wrong.

In my [previous blog post](https://wzbillings.com/posts/2023-07-25_simulating-titer-data/)
I talked about how to simulate a common type of immunological titer data, which
is subject to both interval censoring and a lower limit of detection. In that
blog post, we describing the data generating process for the observed values,
and our simulation depended on the prespecification of the mean and variance of
the distribution. In this blog post, we'll discuss how we can extend the data
generating process to include other variables. In particular, my research
focuses on how *antigenic distance* can affect these titer values, but the
way I'll extend these simulations is very general.
