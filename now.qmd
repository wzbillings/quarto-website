# What is Zane doing right now?

As of **2023-03-06**, this is what I am working on.

## My projects

* I'll be joining StateFarm as a data science intern over the summer! Wow!! So I'll have a
full time job and probably won't get too much research done, but I'll try my best.
* I'm formatting and getting ready to submit a paper about differences between clinical and patient reports of influenza symptoms. Huge shout-out to the great undergrad students I got to work with on this one: [Annika Cleven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annika-cleven/) and [Jackie Dworaczyk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquelinedworaczyk/).
* Writing my dissertation proposal, broadly on these areas.
  + How well did past vaccines confer immunity to future (at the time, they are past now) strains?
  + Is antigenic distance between vaccine strains and circulating strains important for determining how protective the vaccine will be? Fortunately, I've worked with a [great colleague](https://prevention.cancer.gov/about-dcp/staff-search/amanda-skarlupka-phd) who previously did a lot of hard work on this.
  + What is the best way to quantify the "breadth" of a flu response? That is, if you get a vaccine, how can we measure the extent of which flu strains you'll be protected against?
* I'm still reading *Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath. I'm currently working on the Chapter 6 exercises. You can see my progress [here](https://wzbillings.github.io/SR-notes/).
* The norovirus challenge review (finding every norovirus challenge study that's ever been conducted) is currently on hold for a bit, but I hope to come back to it after my proposal and stuff.

## Collaborations
* My colleague [Yang Ge](https://yangepi.github.io/) is now a professor (yay Yang!) and has submitted the norovirus Bayesian modeling paper I did some work on.
* Making a lot of figures for a longitudinal analysis of influenza immune response trajectories. Most of the paper and analysis is being done by [Meng-Hsuan Sung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meng-hsuan-sung-bba0b2228/?trk=public_profile_browsemap).

## Not research stuff
* I'm the TA for my adviser's [Modern Applied Data Analysis](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/) course. We're having a lot of fun doing machine learning and that kind of stuff.
* Currently trying to read, when I get a chance:
  + *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer
  + *The Stand* by Stephen King
  + *Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way* by Will Kurt
