These are the slides I presented on antigenic distance and vaccine breadth at the MICOM antibody working group meeting on January 17, 2025. They contain some progress updates from our group on how we think about broadly reactive vaccines, how to use antigenic distance to improve vaccine candidate selection, and some other related problems we've been thinking about.

The slides are embedded below or you can get them [here](pres.pptx)
if you're interested.
