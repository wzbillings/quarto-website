title: How do pre-existing immunity and host factors interact to impact influenza vaccine response?
abstract: Some prior mechanistic modeling studies show that dose should modulate the effect of an influenza vaccine, but do not make strong predictions about the roles of covariates. Using data from an ongoing cohort study, we examine these predictions and also examine whether other covariates should be included in future models.

My colleague [Savannah](https://smhammerton.com) led a discussion on challenge study ethics at the seminar I coordinate (IDIG, the Infectious Disease Interest Group). The main topic was how to handle including unethical studies in systematic reviews, but we also discussed several other issues related to challenge studies. We only got through half of the powerpoint because we both love to talk, but the slides are embedded below or you can get them [here](pres.pdf) if you're interested.
