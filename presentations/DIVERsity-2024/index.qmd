  immunity
abstract: |
  Research talk given at the 2024 DIVERsity (drivers of individual variation
  in influenza vaccine response and protection from infection) grant annual
  meeting. We use data from a human influenza vaccine cohort study with HAIs
  collected to a panel of historical strains to analyze the causal effect of
  high dose vaccination on the heterologous antibody response.
