I presented these slides at the CEIRR Annual Meeting 2024, specifically at the
Computational Modeling Core tools showcase. They introduce and provide some
motivation for a set of tutorials on censored data that we are currently developing
(at time of writing). The slides are embedded below or you can get them [here](pres.pdf)
if you're interested.

You can access our censored data tutorials at this link: [https://tinyurl.com/hg-cens](https://tinyurl.com/hg-cens).
