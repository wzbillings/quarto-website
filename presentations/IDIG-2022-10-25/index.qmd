I led a discussion of this paper

> Nauta JJ, Beyer WE, Osterhaus AD. On the relationship between mean antibody level, seroprotection and clinical protection from influenza. Biologicals. 2009;37(4):216-221. doi:10.1016/j.biologicals.2009.02.002.

at the seminar I coordinate. It was a pretty interesting paper -- I read a lot about HAI titers and flu vaccines, and I think it's interesting that I haven't really seen a lot of people explicitly address the concerns from this paper. I also think their results extend to a lot of diseases beyond flu, and point to the general issue of "point-estimate-is-the-estimate-ism" that seems so prevalent in science. The slides are embedded below or you can get them [here](pres.pdf) if you're interested.
