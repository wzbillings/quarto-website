  While I might be a dyed-in-the-wool AI hater, that doesn't mean that there
  isn't a very limited subset of useful AI tools. Usually those are the ones

This talk about AI tools that can actually help you do literature review is
from our weekly seminar meeting (the Infectious Disease Interest Group at UGA).
While I'm well known as an AI hater, and my feelings about AI are pretty
well summed up in [this blog post](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/)
(CW: language), there are a few rare AI tools that aren't plagiarism machines or
torment nexuses. Yeah, that surprised me also. It surprised me so much that
I had to give a presentation about them. The slides are embedded below or you can get them [here](pres.pdf) if you're interested.
