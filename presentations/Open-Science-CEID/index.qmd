In January 2023, I was awarded a fellowship by the [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io), funded by [FluLab](https://theflulab.org). I got some excellent open science training, and one stipulation of my fellowship was that I had to share my training knowledge with my colleagues. So I talked about what open science is, why bother with open science, how to start doing open science, and briefly about the [Open Science Foundation](https://osf.io), an online platform developed by OSF to empower open science workflows. The slides are embedded below or you can get them [here](pres.pdf) if you're interested.
