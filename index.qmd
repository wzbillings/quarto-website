I am currently a PhD student working with [Andreas Handel](http://handelgroup.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia (Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics). My main skills are R programming, scientific computing, and data analysis. I like using data science and statistical methods to inform cool questions about viruses, mainly flu.

### Education

**PhD, Epidemiology and biostatistics.** August 2020 -- Present. University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.

**BS, Mathematics and biology.** August 2016 -- May 2020. Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC, USA.

### Interests

* (Bayesian) hierarchical/multilevel models for epidemiological problems
* Effects of antigenic drift on immunity and vaccination
* Epidemiology and immunology of influenza
