I am currently a PhD student working with [Andreas Handel](http://handelgroup.publichealth.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia (Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics). My main skills are R programming, scientific computing, and data analysis. Previously, I obtained my undergraduate degree in mathematics and biology at Western Carolina University. Current research projects include investigating the drivers of immune response to the influenza vaccine at the individual level and examining patient and clinician agreement on reporting of influenza symptoms. You can see my publications, previous projects, and presentations on this website, and if you want you can check out my GitHub or CV for more information about me.
