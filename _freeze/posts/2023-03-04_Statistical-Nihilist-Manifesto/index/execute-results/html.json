Fortunately I'm able to settle that: your\nfavorite statistical paradigm, in particular, is fake and wrong. And just in\ncase you were wondering, it's not \"less wrong\" than any other viewpoint. It's\nstatistics, so it's wrong. Sometimes it's useful, and perhaps your pet method\nis quite often very useful, but it's still wrong and I'm tired of pretending\nthat it isn't.\n\nThere's no such thing as a correct model or a correct method or a real estimate\nor unbiased sample or anything like that. Statistics doesn't even exist in\nreal life and we should stop pretending that it does. I don't think there's a\nparticularly eloquent way for me to convey this (I'm certainly not the best\nperson to write this post), but the main takeaway I want anyone who reads this\nto have is that **all statistics are made up.** Even collecting data or\nmaking observations is only sort of real, but I'm not a philosopher so I won't\nget into perception or whatever here.\n\nLet's start with a simple example: the mean. If you go on an apple-picking\nadventure and all of your friends come and you all pick apples, you can count\nthe number of apples that each of your friends picked. I'm not trying to argue\nwhether or not those counts are real -- it depends on whether you think math\nis real. (I personally think that there is certainly some fundamental concept of\nquantity that *is* real, because there is some perceivable amount of apples\nthat exists independently of our invented human concept of numbers, but at the\ntail end of this debate you get back to the philosophy of perception and what\ndoes it even mean to say something exists and two things are different and\nthat isn't what I'm really interested in here.) You can even calculate the\naverage number of apples that each person has. And you can then proceed to\nsay something glib like \"if we equally divided the apples amount each of us,\nthe number of apples we would each get is this number that I calculated.\" Which\nis true in the sense of that physical application. But that calculated number\nis not a physical thing that exists -- it is a mathematical concept that tells\nyou about a physical problem you want to solve.\n\n\n\n## Last updated {.appendix}\n \n2022-06-24 12:50:12 EDT\n \n## Details {.appendix}\n\n[source code](https://github.com/wzbillings/zlog/tree/master/_posts/posts/2023-03-04_Statistical-Nihilist-Manifesto/index.Rmd)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsessionInfo()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nR version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15 ucrt)\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\nRunning under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19044)\n\nMatrix products: default\n\nlocale:\n[1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8 \n[2] LC_CTYPE=English_United States.utf8   \n[3] LC_MONETARY=English_United States.utf8\n[4] LC_NUMERIC=C                          \n[5] LC_TIME=English_United States.utf8    \n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices datasets  utils     methods   base     \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] digest_0.6.30     jsonlite_1.8.3    magrittr_2.0.3    evaluate_0.17    \n [5] rlang_1.0.6       stringi_1.7.8     cli_3.4.1         renv_0.16.0      \n [9] rmarkdown_2.17    tools_4.2.3       stringr_1.4.1     htmlwidgets_1.5.4\n[13] xfun_0.34         yaml_2.3.6        fastmap_1.1.0     compiler_4.2.3   \n[17] htmltools_0.5.3   knitr_1.40       \n```\n:::\n:::\n",
