    "text": "As of 2022-10-04, this is what I am working on.\n\n\n\nMy main focus right now is a project analyzing the differences between clinical and patient reports of influenza symptoms. Patients seem to be likely to overreport symptoms, and this makes patient-reported data more difficult to use with clinical decision rules. Unfortunately the great undergrad student I got to work with, Annika Cleven, isn’t here anymore, so I have to do all the work myself now.\nI’m sort-of kind-of writing my dissertation proposal in the hopes to defend it in the spring (when I’ll also be taking my comprehensive exam). Most of my proposed aims are about how vaccination affects flu immunity, given that everyone has a different pattern of flu infections and vaccinations.\n\nHow well did past vaccines confer immunity to future (at the time, they are past now) strains?\nIs antigenic distance between vaccine strains and circulating strains important for determining how protective the vaccine will be? Fortunately, I’ve worked with a great colleague who previously did a lot of hard work on this.\nWhat is the best way to quantify the “breadth” of a flu response? That is, if you get a vaccine, how can we measure the extent of which flu strains you’ll be protected against?\n\nI’m still reading Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath. I’m currently working on the Chapter 5 exercises. You can see my progress here.\nThe norovirus challenge review (finding every norovirus challenge study that’s ever been conducted) is currently on hold for a bit, but I hope to come back to it after my proposal and stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy colleague Yang Ge is now a professor (yay Yang!) and has submitted the norovirus Bayesian modeling paper I did some work on.\nMaking a lot of figures for a longitudinal analysis of influenza immune response trajectories. Most of the paper and analysis is being done by Meng-Hsuan Sung.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m still on my department’s curriculum committee. We’re currently revising our department’s competency system and figuring out what course adjustments need to happen (and can happen under the constraints we have).\nI’m the TA for an R programming class, where I mostly help students debug during course time. It’s pretty fun.\nCurrently trying to read, when I get a chance:\n\nThe great influenza by John M.

    "text": "Two negative Abbot BinaxNOW Covid-19 antigen test cards on a dark wooden table, next to a kitchen timer shaped like a chicken.\nPic related: this morning a coworker let me know they had tested positive for COVID-19! As someone who actually prefers to go into the office, I knew that this was one of the dangers, so I was at least prepared for this to happen. I grabbed my government-mailed COVID-19 rapid tests from the closet, checked the expiration date, sat down at the table, and…remembered that flu rapid tests have high false positive rates. Admittedly, I know much more about flu diagnostic testing than COVID.\nThe package insert for the Abbott BinaxNOW tests alleges a 91.7% sensitivity (95% CI: 73.0% - 98.9%), but with the 73% lower bound and my skeptical nature, I decided I better go ahead and do two tests. Of course, being a math degree holder, I can certainly work out for myself how to use Bayes’ Rule to update my beliefs about my COVID status after seeing two tests, but I decided to google it to see if there are any quick and easy guides. And of course, most of what I found in the top google results were articles that didn’t really have much content. So, given the advice I’ve recieved from Andreas Handel and Andrew Heiss, I decided to write up my very first blog post about this subject. Finally, a subject where I feel confident enough to write a blog post about it."

    "section": "Diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity",
    "text": "Diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity\nEvery diagnostic test that produces a dichotomous outcome (for example, COVID-19 positive vs. COVIC-19 negative) has some margin of error. When the test gives you a positive diagnosis, it never means a 100% chance that you are positive. Instead, the test has a probability of being positive, given that you actually have the disease. This probability is called the sensitivity of the test. In math notation, we would write \\[\\mathrm{sensitivity} = P\\left(+ \\mid D\\right)\\] where \\(D\\) is the event that you have the disease (we’ll call the event that you don’t have the disease \\(\\lnot D\\)) and \\(+\\) is the event that you have a positive test (we’ll call the event you have a negative test \\(-\\)). Note that there are only four possibilities with this kind of test.\n\nTrue positive: You actually have the disease, and you test positive.\nFalse positive: You don’t have the disease, but you test positive.\nFalse negative: You actually have the disease, but you test negative.\nTrue negative: You don’t have the disease, and you test negative.\n\nUsing these definitions, the sensitivity of the test is also called the “true positive rate”. Similarly, there is another metric for the test called the specificity, which is called the “true negative rate” and represents the probability that you test negative, given that you do not have the disease. Mathematically, we would write \\[\\mathrm{specificity} = P(- \\mid \\lnot D).\\]\nThese quantities are intrinsic to the test. Theoretically, every type of diagnostic test has a true sensitivity and specificity that we can estimate by using the test on people whose disease status we know. In the US, the companies that make these tests are required to do these studies before their products can be approved by the FDA.\nFor the rest of this blog post, we’ll use the slightly more conservative numbers provided in the package insert: in a multi-site clinical study, the test was estimated to have a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99% (rounding to the nearest percentage).\nHowever, the sensitivity and specificity don’t tell us the information that we actually want to know. What I want to know is, given that I tested negative, what is the probability that I do not have COVID-19?"

    "section": "Bayes’ Rule and the PPV/NPV",
    "text": "Bayes’ Rule and the PPV/NPV\nIn math notation, the quantity that we want to calculate is \\[P(D \\mid +),\\] which is sort of the opposite of the sensitivity of the test. Fortunately, statistics has a convenient way to “flip” the conditional probability: Bayes’ Rule. \\[P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D)P(D)}{P(+)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{sensitivity} \\cdot \\mathrm{prevalence}}{\\text{probability of testing positive}}\\]\nSo, you see that there are two additional components here that we currently don’t know: the prevalence of the disease, which we call \\(P(D)\\), and the probability of testing positive on the test, \\(P(+)\\).\nWe can use another trick to get \\(P(+)\\) called the law of total probability: \\[P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\lnot D) P(\\lnot D).\\]\nUsing some math, we can rewrite this. We know that \\(P(+ \\mid D)\\) is the sensitivity, or true positive rate, so we can rease that \\(P(+ \\mid \\lnot D)\\) is the true negative rate. Additionally, since we either have or don’t have the disease (there is no other outcome), we know that \\(P(\\lnot D) = 1 - P(D)\\), so we get \\[P(+) = \\text{TPR} \\cdot P(D) + \\text{FPR} \\cdot (1 - P(D)).\\]\nWe can get the false positive rate from the specificity by noting that, given you have a negative test, you must either have the disease or not (there are only these two options), so then \\[1 = P(+ \\mid D) + P(+ \\mid \\lnot D) = \\mathrm{TPR} + \\mathrm{FPR}.\\]\nTherefore, the false positive rate is \\(\\mathrm{TPR} = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01\\). Now we just need to know the prevalence of disease. Of course, I had issues getting the Georgia Department of Public Health’s tracker to work, but when I checked the CDC’s COVID data tracker, there was a reported rate of 150.39 cases per 100,000 population, which works out to a prevalence percentage (cases per 100 people) of 0.15% or 0.0015.\nSo finally we can work out that \\[P(+) = (0.85)(0.0015) + (0.01)(0.9985) = 0.00128 + 0.00999 \\approx 0.01270,\\] or about \\(1.3\\%\\). (For Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, on June 24, 2022.) Now that we have estimated the probability of a positive test in general, we can compute the value we actually want, which as I mentioned is called the positive predictive value.\nSo, given that we have a positive test, the probability of actually having COVID would be \\[\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D)P(D)}{P(+)} = \\frac{0.85\\cdot 0.0015}{0.0127} \\approx 0.1004 = 10.04\\%.\\] That might seem low, but of course your risk of having COVID (your personal \\(P(D)\\)) increases drastically if you’ve been around someone else who tested positive. Later on, I’ll vary this number so we can see this effect in action.\nConversely, since you’ve already seen that I tested negative, we might want the negative predictive value: the probability of actually being negative, given that the test was negative. We compute this similarly, so I won’t walk through all the steps this time. We have\n\\[\\mathrm{NPV} = P(\\lnot D \\mid -) = \\frac{P(- \\mid \\lnot D)P(\\lnot D)}{P(-)} = \\frac{P(- \\mid \\lnot D)P(\\lnot D)}{P(- \\mid \\lnot D)P(\\lnot D) + P(- \\mid D)P(D)},\\] which works out mathematically in the same way as the PPV, and we get \\[\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.9985}{(0.99 \\cdot 0.9985) + (0.15\\cdot0.0015)} \\approx 0.9998 \\approx 99.8\\%.\\] Again, remember that this is heavily dependent on what we chose as the prevalence."

That was an interesting experience.\nThe poster can be found here, and is also embedded below. We are continuing our exploration of vaccine cohort data to determine what mechanistic model predictions can be verified by data, and what aspects of mechanistic models may need to be adapted."

    "text": "I gave a two-minute lightning talk at the CIVR-HRP (Center for Influenza) annual meeting in Spring 2022. CIVR-HRP is an NIH-funded CIVIC (Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers) site at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. There were no poster presentations, so I got to give an actual talk.\nInstead of focusing on math and formal statistical analyses, my goal was to describe a conceptual framework (that I believe is novel) for analyzing longitudinal data. Often analyzing an individual’s entire trajectory over several years can be difficult to interpret, but by breaking trajectories down into 3 data points (day 0, day 21/28, and day 365 relative to the yearly vaccination), we can easily examine patterns of boosting and waning.\nIn the future, we intend to use this framework to quantify differences across strata, such as age groups. We also plan to include formal statistical analyses which can account for within-individual correlations.\nThe slides can be found here. They are also embedded below."

I also think their results extend to a lot of diseases beyond flu, and point to the general issue of “point-estimate-is-the-estimate-ism” that seems so prevalent in science.

    "text": "This is a list of everything I use that I could think of to list here. If I forgot anything, feel free to let me know.\n\n\nI actually have three hardware setups. It’s kind of annoying and a big reason that I use Git for everything (but more on that later).\n\nIn my office I use a Dell-prebuilt Precision 5820 with Windows 10 Enterprise. The processor is an Intel Core i9-10980XE 3.00 GHz; 64Gb RAM; AMD Radeon Pro WX 2100 processor.\nIn my house I use a Dell prebuilt that I’ll have to fill in the details for eventually cause I never remember.\nOn the go I use a 2017 12” macbook with the retina screen. It’s super lightweight and I liked that a lot while carrying it everywhere in undergrad, but now I find it very underwhelming for the price point and probably will never buy another Mac.\nMy phone is a Samsung Galaxy A50. I leave it on do-not-disturb so if you aren’t my parents or sister it is unlikely that I will see your texts or calls in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI almost exclusively use R these days.\nSometimes I use Stan. Most of what I do can be facilitated with the R packages rethinking or brms but I’ve been moving more towards using my own Stan code recently.\nMy preferred IDE for everything is RStudio. I use the “Vibrant Ink” theme that comes packaged with the IDE.\nIn the past I’ve used Python (with atom) and MATLAB/Octave (with the GUI), but not so much anymore.\nOn Windows, I exclusively use git bash as my terminal. On MacOS, I use the default terminal but set the language to bash.\nI use Anonymous Pro as my preferred coding font.\n\n\n\n\n\nI use Git and GitHub for nearly everything. Almost all of my new projects (even small things) start by creating an R project with a git repo.\nSpeaking of R projects, I use a .rproj file to organize anything I will do that will involve any amount of R code.\nFor almost all of my research-related writing, I use R Markdown, which is an implementation of pandoc-flavored markdown that can integrate code and the results from running code.\nI’ve recently started using Quarto\nFor course projects that require me to use SAS or don’t involve coding, I use LaTeX. I use MiKTeX for my distribution and TeXStudio for my editor. Although I’m considering just using TinyTex and overleaf since I rarely use LaTeX standalone anymore.\nI use Zotero for almost all of my reference management, although I’ve unfortunately been forced to use EndNote (which I will not provide a link to as I do not endorse it or Clarivate) recently.\nI use bibtex for all of my bibliographies as it works seamlessly with both pandoc and LaTeX.\nI use WinCompose for typing most special characters on Windows.\nI use google drive for anything non-code-related that I need to share. One day I’ll consider switching to Quarto when collaborative editing is out, but that isn’t today. If anyone knows a good markdown alternative, let me know.\nI’ve mostly switched to Quarto for all of my presentations. I still use Powerpoint occasionally (which I hate), but that’s only because I dislike CSS fiddling more than manual fiddling. But Quarto presentations are so much easier than either the old R Markdown presentations or beamer, and they look way better.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past I’ve used Mathematica, but apparently Julia can do everything that Mathematica can do, so I don’t recommend that anyone pay money for Mathematica.\nI’m also pretty good at SAS, but I will never buy a SAS license. Whenever I am forced to use SAS, I use SAS OnDemand for Academics. However, if you are a SAS user, I recommend pivoting away from SAS.\nI do not like using Microsoft Office. But I often find myself using Outlook and OneNote because figuring out anything else would take me time that I do not currently have.\nI use Firefox as my main browser, and I use google chrome when print to PDF in Firefox doesn’t work. Chrome is also required for some R/pandoc procedures for turning HTML into PDF.\nThis website is created with quarto, with source code on GitHub, and deployed by Netlify.\nI manage all my passwords with BitWarden.\nMy time and project management skills are very bad. I use a system cobbled together from OneNote, Outlook’s calendar, sticky notes in the office, and random scribblings on a notepad to manage what I need to get done. Usually it does not work very well, but I’ve never found a system that works better for me."
