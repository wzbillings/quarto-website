I’m getting ready to start a new campaign (as a player! which is still very fun and unusual for me) and I decided that I’m going to go out on a limb and play a fighter this time. And of course, if I’m going to be a fighter, I’m going to have a Cloud Strife, Zabuza, Guts Berserk type of sword.\nAn interesting statistical exercise arises from the fact that Great Weapon Fighting, an ability that makes your fighter character better at using large weapons, is one of the abilities that has been updated in the 2024 edition of the Player’s Handbook. While the change in wording might seem small from just reading the text, the damage distributions of affected weapons is changed a lot. For reference, here’s the text from the 2014 version.\nAnd here’s the text from the 2024 version.\nIn the 2014 version, you can still roll a 1 or 2, although the chance is greatly diminished. In the 2024 version, the lowest number you can roll is a 3. Now, when I first read this, my thought was “oh, clearly the 2024 version is better” which I think is an easy misinterpretation to make. While the threshold for the lowest value you can roll is raised, you are actually less likely to get high rolls with the 2024 version than with the 2014 version. That’s because those rerolls are powerful – instead of just increasing the probability of a 3, they increase the probability of rolling values that are higher than three.\nOf course, as a statistical something-or-other, my inclination was to quantify how influential this effect as. And as a D&D player since 2016-ish (hard to believe it’s been 8 years…), I thought this would be a pretty fun problem to solve. It’s also not too difficult, fortunately. So let’s walk through the solution.\nOne major caveat is that which of the versions is better depends on the die we’re rolling. For example, if we’re rolling four-sided dice (d4’s in D&D nomenclature), bumping our lower values up to three will have a larger impact on the expected value of our rolls than if we’re rolling a d12. So I’ll work this problem out for the two most common types of damage rolls for a GWF-affected heavy weapon in 5th edition D&D: a weapon that does 1d12 damage, and a weapon that does 2d6 damage. I have, for some time, been a 2d6 fan (because rolling more dice is more fun) and it turns out the resulting distributions in the 2d6 case are more interesting, so that’s yet another reason to make a character using a greatsword, which is one of those 2d6 weapons."

    "text": "No GWF\nThe case for no GWF is simple. For the 1d12 weapon, assuming the die is fair, the distribution is just \\(1/12\\) for each of the values. The distribution for 2d6 is not much more complicated, and is a common problem in introductory probability courses and textbooks. I’ll use a set of helper functions that will be useful for more complex problems that I included in the enumeration code file.\nHere’s the table of probabilities for a 2d6 weapon with no GWF.\n\n\nShow the code\nget_distribution(6, 2, \"none\", FALSE) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nfreq\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n0.0278\n\n\n3\n2\n0.0556\n\n\n4\n3\n0.0833\n\n\n5\n4\n0.1111\n\n\n6\n5\n0.1389\n\n\n7\n6\n0.1667\n\n\n8\n5\n0.1389\n\n\n9\n4\n0.1111\n\n\n10\n3\n0.0833\n\n\n11\n2\n0.0556\n\n\n12\n1\n0.0278\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the normal rules for calculating the mean and standard deviation from this kind of distribution table, we can get that in summary:\n\nthe 1d12 weapon will have an expected value of \\(6.50 ± 3.45\\); and\nthe 2d6 weapon will have an expected value of \\(7.00 ± 2.42\\).\n\nOf course these summary metrics are not the only useful information for us, but they are a concise way to represent the amount of damage we can expect to do with one attack."

    "text": "2024 GWF\n\nGreat Weapon Fighting. When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit. — Player’s Handbook, 2024.\n\nI’m doing the 2024 version first because it’s actually less interesting than the 2014 version. To compute the probabilities for one die, we can calculate all the same probabilities from the no GWF case, and then compute the probability of rolling a three as the probability of rolling a three or less. That is, \\[\nP(3 \\mid \\text{2024 GWF}) = P(1 \\mid \\text{no GWF}) +\nP(2 \\mid \\text{no GWF}) +\nP(3 \\mid \\text{no GWF}).\n\\]\nSo for a 1d12 weapon, the probability of rolling a 3 would be \\(3/12 = 1/4\\), the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 is \\(0\\), and the probability of rolling any other number \\(4, 5, \\ldots, 12\\) is \\(1/12\\) as before.\n\n\nShow the code\nget_distribution(12, 1, \"new\", FALSE) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nfreq\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n0.2500\n\n\n4\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n5\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n6\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n7\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n8\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n9\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n10\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n11\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n12\n1\n0.0833\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a 2d6 weapon, we have the additional issue of having to add two dice together. So while the same formula works for one dice, like so:\n\n\nShow the code\nget_distribution(6, 1, \"new\", FALSE) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nfreq\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n3\n3\n0.5000\n\n\n4\n1\n0.1667\n\n\n5\n1\n0.1667\n\n\n6\n1\n0.1667\n\n\n\n\n\nwe need to calculate the distribution of the sum. The function that I’m using does this by enumerating all of the possible combinations of the two die rolls, calculating the sum of each combination, and normalizing to get the percentages. For the 2024 version of GWF, we can get the combinations in the correct proportions by finding the combinations of \\(k\\) dice with the faces \\(3, 3, 3, 4, 5, \\ldots, n\\) instead of \\(1, 2, \\ldots, n\\). This tactic of using one die with modified faces will be crucial for the 2014 GWF probabilities so it’s nice to think about this problem that way.\nAnyways, calculating the probabilities in that way gives the following table for a 2d6 weapon.\n\n\nShow the code\nget_distribution(6, 2, \"new\", FALSE) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nfreq\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n6\n9\n0.2500\n\n\n7\n6\n0.1667\n\n\n8\n7\n0.1944\n\n\n9\n8\n0.2222\n\n\n10\n3\n0.0833\n\n\n11\n2\n0.0556\n\n\n12\n1\n0.0278\n\n\n\n\n\nIt makes sense that 6 is the lowest value we can roll – each of the two dice has to be a 3 or greater. The dip in probability for 7 is interesting though, because 7 is famously the most common number to roll for 2d6 without any special rules. This distribution also forms an interesting asymmetrical shape with a weird dip in it.\nIn summary: for the 2024 GWF version, we get\n\nthe 1d12 weapon will have an expected value of \\(6.75 ± 3.11\\); and\nthe 2d6 weapon will have an expected value of \\(8.00 ± 1.63\\).\n\nInterestingtly, the expected improvement is much higher for the 2d6 weapon than for the 1d12 weapon. That’s a combination of the effect of improving two die rolls instead of just one, and the fact that the new correction is better for weapons with smaller damage dice. So maybe a weapon that uses a sum of d4s (or d3s? lol) would be best with this correction. Like a greatwhip or something else that doesn’t exist."

    "text": "2014 GWF\n\nGreat Weapon Fighting. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. — Player’s Handbook, 2014.\n\nThe 2014 GWF case is the hardest one to calculate analytically. The trick to this one is to stop thinking about the problem as “one die roll, and sometimes a second one”. Thinking about it that way will give you results, but it is conceptually more difficult. Instead we should try and reframe the problem as “if I were only rolling one die, what faces would that die have to have?” The die for this problem will certainly not exist in real life, so first let’s take the 1d12 case as an example.\n\nWe can get a 1 by rolling either a 1 or 2, which will cause us to reroll, and then rolling a 1 on the second die. These are the ONLY ways we can roll a 1 for the result. So there are two ways we can get a 1.\nWe can get a 2 by rolling either a 1 or 2, triggering a reroll, then then rolling a 2. So similarly there are two ways we can get a 2 as our result.\nWe can get a 3 by rolling a 3 on the first die, or by rolling either a 1 or 2 on the first die, and then a 3 on the second die. The tricky part is changing how we think about this roll.\nWe can get a 4, 5, whatever, up to 12, in the exact same way as a 3, those numbers are all equally likely.\n\nTo think about the probability of rolling a 3, imaging that you always roll the second die. However, if the result of the first die is not a 1 or a 2, we just ignore the second die. Since we’re rolling 2d12, that means there are 144 possible outcomes, and if we were going to roll one hypothetical die, it would have to be 144 faces. (Or in general, \\(n^2\\) faces for an \\(n\\)-sided die.) From what we established above, there have to be two faces with a 1 on them, and then two faces with a 2 on them. Then we have 140 faces left to fill with 10 equally likely outcomes, so each remaining die has to get \\(14\\) faces.\nWe can also think about choosing the number of faces that show, e.g., a 3, like this. If we roll a three on the first d12, there are twelve ways we can roll the second d12 and the outcome will still be 3. However, if we roll a 1 or 2 on the first d12, and then a 3 on the second d12, that gives us 2 more ways to get a 3 overall. So we see we can get \\(12 + 2 = 14\\) (or in the general case, \\(n+2\\)) faces with a 3 on them. And the math works out the same for faces numbered \\(4, \\ldots, 12\\).\nThat means the probability of rolling a given number is given by the number of faces showing that number divided by the total number of faces. So that’s \\[P(1) = P(2) = 2 / 144; \\quad P(3) = \\ldots = P(12) = 14 / 144.\\]\nThe table is shown below.\n\n\nShow the code\nget_distribution(12, 1, \"old\", FALSE) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nfreq\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n0.0139\n\n\n2\n2\n0.0139\n\n\n3\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n4\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n5\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n6\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n7\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n8\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n9\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n10\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n11\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n12\n14\n0.0972\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, that’s for just one die. If we want to roll multiple dice, say 2d6, under the 2014 GWF rules, we are actually rolling two of those special \\(n^2\\) faced dies we just discovered. Then we can get all of the combinations of two of those special dice and find the distribution of their sum. That’s exactly what the get_distribution() function is doing to get the following table.\n\n\nShow the code\nget_distribution(6, 2, \"old\", FALSE) |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nfreq\nrel_freq\n\n\n\n\n2\n4\n0.0031\n\n\n3\n8\n0.0062\n\n\n4\n36\n0.0278\n\n\n5\n64\n0.0494\n\n\n6\n128\n0.0988\n\n\n7\n192\n0.1481\n\n\n8\n224\n0.1728\n\n\n9\n256\n0.1975\n\n\n10\n192\n0.1481\n\n\n11\n128\n0.0988\n\n\n12\n64\n0.0494\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that now, 9 is the mostly likely outcome instead of 7, and the low rolls of 2 and 3 are much less likely as well.\nIn summary: for the 2014 GWF version, we get\n\nthe 1d12 weapon will have an expected value of \\(7.33 ± 3.00\\); and\nthe 2d6 weapon will have an expected value of \\(8.33 ± 2.01\\).\n\nSo again, it seems that the improvement favors the 2d6 weapon instead of the 1d12 weapon. The effect of benefitting two dice instead of just one die seems to be quite strong."

Of course, the distributions for the 2d6 weapon damage are in general more interesting than for 1d12. For 1d12, we can see that the 2024 outcome really boosts the probability of rolling a 3 but is otherwise exactly the same as having no GWF, while the 2014 outcome slightly boosts the probability of each number 3 or larger but drastically lowers the chance of getting a 1 or 2.\nFor the 2d6 outcome, we can see that both corrections have an obvious impact that increases the average amount of damage, but in weird ways that are (at least to me) not incredibly intuitive. For the 2014 GWF distribution, 9 is the most common outcome, but for 2024, 9 is the second most common outcome after 6.\nSo, it seems that using either ability is obviously better than using neither. But it’s hard to tell whether the 2014 or the 2024 ability is better. It probably depends on our personal loss aversion bias – if you really don’t like rolling low numbers and want to more consistently reach a minimum value, then the 2024 version is better for you. However on the other hand, we can see that the 2014 version, we are more likely to roll high values. So if getting a few 1’s and 2’s is worth it for the times you get 10’s, 11’s, and 12’s, the 2014 version is for you.\nWe can see this more clearly if we look at the results a bit differently."

But when we’re trying to decide which of the two options we prefer, it can be more helpful to look at the cumulative probabilities. The cumulative probability \\(P(X \\leq x)\\) can be interpreted as “the probability that we roll at most some value \\(x\\)”.\nFor many people, and certainly for me, it is typically easier to understand \\(P(X \\geq x)\\), “the probability that we roll at least some value \\(x\\)”.

This is often a great strategy, but for this example the analytical computation is simple enough that it’s not worth doing a simulation. However, the more dice you start rolling, the more RAM it takes to enumerate combinations and the more worthwhile it becomes to just do a simulation. You can see my example simulation code in the code links.\nA much simpler way to do this is to use the specialized web app AnyDice by Jasper Flick. Implementing an AnyDice program for this comparison takes only 3 lines of code, although I’ve modified this so that \\(n\\), the number of faces on the dice, and \\(k\\), the number of dice to roll, are variables that you can easily change all at once.\nInformation from the Player’s Handbook is not owned by me, and is included here under fair use for educational purposes (although it seems prudent to mention that all of the information included here is also licensed under the Open Game License Version 1.0a and is included in the Basic Rules).

In that blog post, we describing the data generating process for the observed values, and our simulation depended on the prespecification of the mean and variance of the distribution. In this blog post, we’ll discuss how we can extend the data generating process to include other variables. In particular, my research focuses on how antigenic distance can affect these titer values, but the way I’ll extend these simulations is very general.\nFirst let’s review the data-generating process – this is actually probably better written than my original post on this, because I’ve been thinking about these issues a lot and trying to improve my descriptions and notations."

    "text": "Data-generating process without covariates\nIf we recall our DGP from the previous post, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nz_i^* &\\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu, \\sigma^2\\right) \\\\\nz_i &= \\max\\left\\{0, \\left\\lfloor z_i^* \\right\\rfloor \\right\\} \\\\\ny_i &= g(z_i) = 5 \\cdot 2 ^{z_i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] This data generation process is composed of the following parts:\n\nThe log-scale latent titer, \\(z_i^*\\), which is a real-valued random variable;\nThe log-scale censored titer, \\(z_i\\), which is a nonnegative integer- valued random variable. This reflects the limit of detection – our transformation function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) which takes us from the natural scale to the log scale ensures that the limit of detection is represented as \\(0\\) on the log scale. So if \\(z_i\\) is below the log-scale LoD, it gets rounded up to \\(0\\). Otherwise, we take the floor of the underlying titer to represent interval-censoring in our measurements.\nThe natural-scale observed titer, \\(y_i\\), is a nonnegative integer on the natural scale and so takes values in the set \\(\\{5, 10, 20, 40, \\ldots \\}\\). This value has been censored and transformed back to the natural scale.\n\nThis data generating process assumes that the latent titers follow a log-normal distribution. Another plausible model would be a gamma distribution, which is somewhat more annoying to deal with, so we’ll deal with that in a future post.\nNow, I promised we would incorporate some covariates, so that’s what we’ll do next."

    "section": "Perfectly known covariates and linear models",
    "text": "Perfectly known covariates and linear models\nThere are a lot of different ways to incorporate covariates into this type of model, but the most common way by far is to make the mean titer value dependent on the value of some covariate, i.e., we would add the line \\[\\mu_i = f(x_i) \\] to the DGP above. Choosing the correct function here is a very complex problem which relies on “good-enough” approximations in the real world. One incredibly simple, but also very useful, function is the simple linear regression model. Linear models cover a wide range of patterns, but in the simple linear model, we assume that \\(f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\), which is a linear function of \\(x\\). For my specific example of incorporating antigenic distance, \\(d\\) into the data generating process, we’ll use this simple linear regression model.\nAt the risk of repeating a lot of text, our data generating process when the mean of the titer depends on the antigenic distance in a linear relationship is as follows.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nz_i^* &\\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2\\right) \\\\\n\\mu_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot d_i \\\\\nz_i &= \\max\\left\\{0, \\left\\lfloor z_i^* \\right\\rfloor \\right\\} \\\\\ny_i &= g(z_i) = 5 \\cdot 2 ^{z_i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe would expect \\(\\beta_0 &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\beta_1 &lt; 0\\) here. The parameter \\(\\beta_0\\) would correspond to the homologous immune response – we’re testing the HAI titer against the exact same strain a person has been exposed to. The parameter \\(\\beta_1\\) then represents the expected decrease in the immune response as a test strain becomes further away from the exposure strain. If we normalize our distances to fall in \\([0, 1]\\), where \\(0\\) is the homologous strain and \\(1\\) is the maximally different strain (although still not completely different, depending on the sample), we would also note that \\[E[y \\mid x = 1] - E[y \\mid x = 0] = \\mu(1) - \\mu(0) = \\beta_1,\\] so we can interpret \\(\\beta_1\\) as the difference in the mean response between the maximally distant strain and the homologous strain. If the maximally distant strain should represent a completely novel strain for which there should be no immune response, we could enforce the constraint \\[\\mu_i(1) = 0 \\implies \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 = 0,\\] which is linear and could be incorporated into a solution using a constrained maximum likelihood estimation framework.\nThe data is easy to simulate, similar to the previous example. For a test example, we assume that we can choose which antigenic distances to measure, and at each antigenic distance, we obtain some number of independent titer values (we could relax the independence assumption here by using a more complex model, but we choose not to deal with that right now).\nFor this example, we’ll set our distances for each individual to be \\(d_i = \\{0, 0.1, 0.2, \\ldots, 1.0\\}\\), and we’ll assume we have \\(1000\\) individuals. We collect their titers at each distance. For our simulation parameters, we’ll set \\(\\beta_0 = 4\\), \\(\\beta_1 = -3\\), and \\(\\sigma^2 = 2\\).\nWe start with the same simulation function we used previously.\n\none_titer_sim &lt;- function(N = 1e4, seed = 370, mean = 3, sd = 1) {\n    set.seed(seed)\n    sim &lt;-\n        tibble::tibble(\n            # Assume log(titer) is drawn from a normal distribution\n            raw_log_titer = rnorm(N, mean, sd),\n            # If we observe a titer with log(titer) &lt; 1 (LOD), mark it as 0\n            trunc_log_titer = ifelse(raw_log_titer &gt;= 1, raw_log_titer, 0),\n            # The assay is dilution based, so we only observe the floor of each\n            # value.\n            rounded_titer = floor(trunc_log_titer),\n            # Now final observed titer is equal to this transformation.\n            sim_titer = 5 * 2 ^ rounded_titer\n        ) |&gt;\n        dplyr::arrange(raw_log_titer)\n}\n\nThen, we calculate the value of \\(\\mu_i\\) at each value of \\(d_i\\), and draw 1000 observations at each \\(\\mu\\) value.\n\nex_dist_sim &lt;-\n    tibble::tibble(\n        d = seq(0, 1, 0.1),\n        mu = 4 - 3 * d\n    ) |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        sim = purrr::map(mu, \\(x) one_titer_sim(1000, mean = x, sd = 2))\n    ) |&gt;\n    tidyr::unnest(sim)\n\nplt &lt;-\n    ex_dist_sim |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(\n        sim_titer = factor(sim_titer),\n        mu = factor(mu) |&gt; forcats::fct_inorder(),\n        distance = factor(d) |&gt; forcats::fct_inorder()\n    ) |&gt;\n    ggplot() +\n    aes(x = sim_titer) +\n    geom_bar(col = \"black\", fill = \"gray\") +\n    facet_wrap(~distance, labeller = \"label_both\") +\n    labs(\n        x = \"Observed titer\",\n        y = \"Count\"\n    ) +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +\n    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 700))\nfn &lt;- here::here(\"posts\", \"2023-08-10_Titer-w-Distance\", \"thumbnail.png\")\nggsave(\n    filename = fn,\n    plot = plt,\n    width = 13,\n    height = 8\n)\nknitr::include_graphics(fn)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we simulate a more extreme example, say where \\(|\\beta_1| &gt; \\beta_0\\), we can generate titers which decay rapidly towards the limit of detection.

Often analyzing an individual’s entire trajectory over several years can be difficult to interpret, but by breaking trajectories down into 3 data points (day 0, day 21/28, and day 365 relative to the yearly vaccination), we can easily examine patterns of boosting and waning.\nIn the future, we intend to use this framework to quantify differences across strata, such as age groups. We also plan to include formal statistical analyses which can account for within-individual correlations.\nThe slides can be found here. They are also embedded below."

While antigenic drift is known to be a major problem in the development of influenza vaccines, quantifying the effect of antigenic drift on the immune response after vaccination is more difficult. We use data from an influenza vaccine cohort where a panel of heterologous HAI assays was conducted on each individual’s serum samples, and we computed the antigenic distance between each of the assay strains and the strain used for vaccination to estimate the effect of antigenic distance on vaccine immunogenicity. We found nonlinear negative patterns for both H3N2 and H1N1 influenza strains.\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 9, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n😱 SUPERCHARGE 🌩 YOUR LIT REVIEW 📖 WORKFLOW WITH 🤖 ~AI TOOLS~ 🤯\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntalk\n\n\nother\n\n\n\nWhile I might be a dyed-in-the-wool AI hater, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a very limited subset of useful AI tools.

It’s kind of annoying and a big reason that I use Git for everything (but more on that later).\n\nIn my office I use a Dell-prebuilt Precision 5820 with Windows 10 Enterprise. The processor is an Intel Core i9-10980XE 3.00 GHz; 64Gb RAM; AMD Radeon Pro WX 2100 processor.\nIn my house I use a Dell prebuilt that I’ll have to fill in the details for eventually cause I never remember.\nOn the go I use a 2017 12” macbook with the retina screen. It’s super lightweight and I liked that a lot while carrying it everywhere in undergrad, but now I find it very underwhelming for the price point and probably will never buy another Mac.\nMy phone is a Samsung Galaxy A50. I leave it on do-not-disturb so if you aren’t my parents or sister it is unlikely that I will see your texts or calls in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n\n\n\n\nI almost exclusively use R these days.\nSometimes I use Stan. Most of what I do can be facilitated with the R packages rethinking or brms but I’ve been moving more towards using my own Stan code recently.\nMy preferred IDE for everything is RStudio. I use the “Vibrant Ink” theme that comes packaged with the IDE.\nIn the past I’ve used Python (with atom) and MATLAB/Octave (with the GUI), but not so much anymore.\nOn Windows, I exclusively use git bash as my terminal. On MacOS, I use the default terminal but set the language to bash.\nI use Anonymous Pro as my preferred coding font.\n\n\n\n\n\nI use Git and GitHub for nearly everything. Almost all of my new projects (even small things) start by creating an R project with a git repo.\nSpeaking of R projects, I use a .rproj file to organize anything I will do that will involve any amount of R code.\nFor almost all of my research-related writing, I use R Markdown, which is an implementation of pandoc-flavored markdown that can integrate code and the results from running code.\nI’ve recently started using Quarto\nFor course projects that require me to use SAS or don’t involve coding, I use LaTeX. I use MiKTeX for my distribution and TeXStudio for my editor. Although I’m considering just using TinyTex and overleaf since I rarely use LaTeX standalone anymore.\nI use Zotero for almost all of my reference management, although I’ve unfortunately been forced to use EndNote (which I will not provide a link to as I do not endorse it or Clarivate) recently.\nI use bibtex for all of my bibliographies as it works seamlessly with both pandoc and LaTeX.\nI use WinCompose for typing most special characters on Windows.\nI use google drive for anything non-code-related that I need to share. One day I’ll consider switching to Quarto when collaborative editing is out, but that isn’t today.

Using data from an ongoing cohort study, we examine these predictions and also examine whether other covariates should be included in future models. For this presentation, we focused on the effects of vaccine dose, whether the participant was vaccinated in the previous year, and the age of the participant."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my talk from the 2023 CEIRR annual meeting. You can find my slides here as well as embedded at the bottom of the page.\nSummary: We’re currently working on how to quantify the “breadth” of a vaccine based on immunogenicity measurements from cohort studies. In our framework, we compute the antigenic distance of all the strains used for immune measurements and use the distance to creature antibody landscapes. From the antibody landscapes, we can compute summary statistics for the strength and breadth of the vaccine which we believe are more robust to the choice of strains used in the study than traditional methods. However, there are several methodological issues, primarily the issue of data points at the limit of detection, that we need to address to fairly test our framework. We are currently working on Bayesian hiearchical models as a strategy for mitigating the limitations of our method.\nOfficial abstract: HAI titer is a commonly used metric for assessing the immunogenicity of the seasonal influenza vaccine to the virus strains used in the formulation of the vaccine antigen. A next-generation influenza vaccine should induce protection to similar strains, but an ideal vaccine candidate would also elicit a response to other variants. An antigenic distance measurement is a way to quantify how different two variants are and can be combined with immunogenicity measurements to a panel of different viral strains following vaccination in order to assess the breadth of the vaccine response. Building on previous literature on antibody landscapes, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for reducing noise across individual antibody landscapes and obtain measurements of the homologous and heterologous vaccine response that take antigenic distance into account. Various weighting systems can then be applied to our measurements in order to fairly judge vaccine candidates in different scenarios. We examine the strengths and limitations of our metrics by using both generative simulations and a case study with real-world immunogenicity data."

As someone who actually prefers to go into the office, I knew that this was one of the dangers, so I was at least prepared for this to happen. I grabbed my government-mailed COVID-19 rapid tests from the closet, checked the expiration date, sat down at the table, and…remembered that flu rapid tests have high false positive rates. Admittedly, I know much more about flu diagnostic testing than COVID.\nThe package insert for the Abbott BinaxNOW tests alleges a 91.7% sensitivity (95% CI: 73.0% - 98.9%), but with the 73% lower bound and my skeptical nature, I decided I better go ahead and do two tests. Of course, being a math degree holder, I can certainly work out for myself how to use Bayes’ Rule to update my beliefs about my COVID status after seeing two tests, but I decided to google it to see if there are any quick and easy guides. And of course, most of what I found in the top google results were articles that didn’t really have much content. So, given the advice I’ve recieved from Andreas Handel and Andrew Heiss, I decided to write up my very first blog post about this subject. Finally, a subject where I feel confident enough to write a blog post about it."

    "text": "Diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity\nEvery diagnostic test that produces a dichotomous outcome (for example, COVID-19 positive vs. COVIC-19 negative) has some margin of error. When the test gives you a positive diagnosis, it never means a 100% chance that you are positive. Instead, the test has a probability of being positive, given that you actually have the disease. This probability is called the sensitivity of the test. In math notation, we would write \\[\\mathrm{sensitivity} = P\\left(+ \\mid D\\right)\\] where \\(D\\) is the event that you have the disease (we’ll call the event that you don’t have the disease \\(\\lnot D\\)) and \\(+\\) is the event that you have a positive test (we’ll call the event you have a negative test \\(-\\)). Note that there are only four possibilities with this kind of test.\n\nTrue positive: You actually have the disease, and you test positive.\nFalse positive: You don’t have the disease, but you test positive.\nFalse negative: You actually have the disease, but you test negative.\nTrue negative: You don’t have the disease, and you test negative.\n\nUsing these definitions, the sensitivity of the test is also called the “true positive rate”. Similarly, there is another metric for the test called the specificity, which is called the “true negative rate” and represents the probability that you test negative, given that you do not have the disease. Mathematically, we would write \\[\\mathrm{specificity} = P(- \\mid \\lnot D).\\]\nThese quantities are intrinsic to the test. Theoretically, every type of diagnostic test has a true sensitivity and specificity that we can estimate by using the test on people whose disease status we know. In the US, the companies that make these tests are required to do these studies before their products can be approved by the FDA.\nFor the rest of this blog post, we’ll use the slightly more conservative numbers provided in the package insert: in a multi-site clinical study, the test was estimated to have a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99% (rounding to the nearest percentage).\nHowever, the sensitivity and specificity don’t tell us the information that we actually want to know. What I want to know is, given that I tested negative, what is the probability that I do not have COVID-19?"

    "text": "Bayes’ Rule and the PPV/NPV\nIn math notation, the quantity that we want to calculate is \\[P(D \\mid +),\\] which is sort of the opposite of the sensitivity of the test. Fortunately, statistics has a convenient way to “flip” the conditional probability: Bayes’ Rule. \\[P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D)P(D)}{P(+)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{sensitivity} \\cdot \\mathrm{prevalence}}{\\text{probability of testing positive}}\\]\nSo, you see that there are two additional components here that we currently don’t know: the prevalence of the disease, which we call \\(P(D)\\), and the probability of testing positive on the test, \\(P(+)\\).\nWe can use another trick to get \\(P(+)\\) called the law of total probability: \\[P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\lnot D) P(\\lnot D).\\]\nUsing some math, we can rewrite this. We know that \\(P(+ \\mid D)\\) is the sensitivity, or true positive rate, so we can rease that \\(P(+ \\mid \\lnot D)\\) is the true negative rate. Additionally, since we either have or don’t have the disease (there is no other outcome), we know that \\(P(\\lnot D) = 1 - P(D)\\), so we get \\[P(+) = \\text{TPR} \\cdot P(D) + \\text{FPR} \\cdot (1 - P(D)).\\]\nWe can get the false positive rate from the specificity by noting that, given you have a negative test, you must either have the disease or not (there are only these two options), so then \\[1 = P(+ \\mid D) + P(+ \\mid \\lnot D) = \\mathrm{TPR} + \\mathrm{FPR}.\\]\nTherefore, the false positive rate is \\(\\mathrm{TPR} = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01\\). Now we just need to know the prevalence of disease. Of course, I had issues getting the Georgia Department of Public Health’s tracker to work, but when I checked the CDC’s COVID data tracker, there was a reported rate of 150.39 cases per 100,000 population, which works out to a prevalence percentage (cases per 100 people) of 0.15% or 0.0015.\nSo finally we can work out that \\[P(+) = (0.85)(0.0015) + (0.01)(0.9985) = 0.00128 + 0.00999 \\approx 0.01270,\\] or about \\(1.3\\%\\). (For Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, on June 24, 2022.) Now that we have estimated the probability of a positive test in general, we can compute the value we actually want, which as I mentioned is called the positive predictive value.\nSo, given that we have a positive test, the probability of actually having COVID would be \\[\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D)P(D)}{P(+)} = \\frac{0.85\\cdot 0.0015}{0.0127} \\approx 0.1004 = 10.04\\%.\\] That might seem low, but of course your risk of having COVID (your personal \\(P(D)\\)) increases drastically if you’ve been around someone else who tested positive. Later on, I’ll vary this number so we can see this effect in action.\nConversely, since you’ve already seen that I tested negative, we might want the negative predictive value: the probability of actually being negative, given that the test was negative. We compute this similarly, so I won’t walk through all the steps this time. We have\n\\[\\mathrm{NPV} = P(\\lnot D \\mid -) = \\frac{P(- \\mid \\lnot D)P(\\lnot D)}{P(-)} = \\frac{P(- \\mid \\lnot D)P(\\lnot D)}{P(- \\mid \\lnot D)P(\\lnot D) + P(- \\mid D)P(D)},\\] which works out mathematically in the same way as the PPV, and we get \\[\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.9985}{(0.99 \\cdot 0.9985) + (0.15\\cdot0.0015)} \\approx 0.9998 \\approx 99.8\\%.\\] Again, remember that this is heavily dependent on what we chose as the prevalence."

This is why we got the specific qualitative behavior we observed earlier.\nNote that a regression offset is a term that is included on the right-hand side of a linear model, but the coefficient is pre-specified as 1, and not estimated as part of the model fit.\n\nmod1 &lt;- lm(log_post ~ log_pre, data = sim_dat)\nmod2 &lt;- lm(TI ~ log_pre, data = sim_dat)\nmod3 &lt;- lm(TI ~ log_pre, data = sim_dat, offset = (-1 * log_pre))\n\nHere we can see that model 1 and model 3 recover the parameters from the generative model, while if we fit model 2, we get a biased coefficient that is exactly equal to 1 minus the estimated parameter from the other two models.

For example, we could add \\(\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathrm{age}\\) into our generative model and our regression models, and we would see the same pattern. However, if we incorporate nonlinearity (e.g. interaction effects or hierarchical effects), understanding how the models are related might not be that simple to solve, because in those cases we can’t necessarily combine the offset term with something else to simplify the model."

Exact and asymptotic limits are all great, but unfortunately they have to exist before you can calculate them, and these methods are often very analytically difficult (requiring, e.g., Taylor series analysis). We can often trade off computational power for analytical problem solving using the bootstrap method to construct pretty good confidence intervals instead.\nI’ll start by going over what I think is the most intuitive approach for bootstrap CIs, the percentile method. This method has some limitations though, so I’ll talk about the BCa adjustment which can produce better results, and I’ll talk about how to get these CIs with the boot package in R."

    "text": "Example problem setup\nFor an example, we’ll make some simulated data that’s similar to the situation where we actually need to use a bootstrap CI in my lab group’s research. We’ll consider a fairly simple example: in a study sample of size \\(n = n_t + n_p\\), where \\(n_t\\) people get a vaccine and \\(n_p\\) people get a placebo. They are followed up for an appropriate amount of time (or challenge with virus, your choice), and we record which individuals get infected and which do not. For this simulated example, the effect we are interested in measuring is the vaccine effectiveness, which can be calculated from the risk ratio. That is, \\[\\mathrm{VE} = 1 - \\mathrm{RR} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{risk in vaccine group}}{\\text{risk in placebo group}}.\\] To do this, we’ll simulate infection data for both groups. If we want our target VE to be, say, \\(75\\%\\), we want the risk ratio to be \\(25\\%\\), and we can set the two prevalences however we want, as long as they are sensible prevalences (between \\(0\\%\\) and \\(100\\%\\)) and their ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). So for ease of computation, let’s say that the risk in the vaccine group is \\(10\\%\\) and the risk in the placebo group is \\(40\\%\\). Let’s simulate 100 patients where 50 are in the placebo group and 50 are in the vaccine group.\n\nset.seed(134122)\nn &lt;- 100L\nsim_dat &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n    # Treatment is 0 for placebo, 1 for vaccinated\n    treatment = rep(c(0, 1), each = n / 2),\n    outcome = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = rep(c(0.4, 0.1), each = n / 2))\n)\n\ntable(\n    sim_dat$treatment,\n    sim_dat$outcome,\n    dnn = c(\"treatment\", \"outcome\")\n) |&gt;\n    addmargins()\n\n         outcome\ntreatment   0   1 Sum\n      0    27  23  50\n      1    43   7  50\n      Sum  70  30 100\n\n\nIf we look at our table, we see that we get estimated risks of \\(23/50 = 46\\%\\) in the placebo group, and \\(7/50 = 14\\%\\) in the vaccine group, giving us an observed VE of \\(1 - 0.3043 \\approx 70\\%.\\) This is close to what we know is the true VE in the simulation, but different enough that we can immediately see the effect of sampling variability. Of course, as we simulate increasingly more people, we will get a more accurate estimate of the VE.\nNow, we might want to construct a confidence interval for our sample, which would ideally cover the true VE. But we forgot all the different methods for building confidence intervals for the risk ratio, no matter how many of them they taught us or how many times we covered it during epidemiology class. (Or if you’re like me, you did an epidemiology PhD without any intro to epi classes and never really learned…) So fortunately for us, nonparametric bootstrapping provides a really convenient and flexible way to “automatically” get a CI, as long as we have a relatively modern computer – even though bootstrapping is called a computer intensive method, for simple statistics like this one, you can get bootstrap intervals pretty fast even on cheap hardware."

    "text": "Constructing resamples\nThe first step of computing a bootstrap CI is to construct the bootstrap distribution. Bootstrapping refers to a specific type of resampling process that’s similar to cross-validation or leave-one-out methods. Call our entire data set \\(D\\). We construct a bootstrap resample \\(D_i\\) (\\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, B\\) where \\(B\\) is the number of bootstrap resamples we do) by sampling with replacement \\(n\\) records from \\(D\\). This means that each resample can have the same observation repeated multiple times, and does not have to include every observation (in fact, we can use the bootstrap similarly to cross-validation for model tuning by using the bootstrap resample as the analysis set and the points not included in the resample as the assessment set). We resample in this way specifically, because it leads to specific properties (under certain regularity conditions) which allow our confidence intervals to work correctly. (Math details omitted since they’re complicated and honestly not too important for what we’re trying to do here.)\nWe could of course do this by hand.\n\nset.seed(3547512)\nB &lt;- 199L\nres &lt;- matrix(nrow = B, ncol = 4)\ncolnames(res) &lt;- c(\"p_p\", \"p_t\", \"RR\", \"VE\")\nfor (i in 1:B) {\n    # Sample the data indices that we should use for this sample\n    idx &lt;- sample.int(nrow(sim_dat), replace = TRUE)\n    D_i &lt;- sim_dat[idx, ]\n    # Code to calculate the risk in the placebo group and the risk in the\n    # treatment group\n    # We could write this in a much more compact/efficient way, but I did it\n    # this way for readability\n    p_p &lt;- D_i |&gt;\n        dplyr::filter(treatment == 0) |&gt;\n        dplyr::pull(outcome) |&gt;\n        mean()\n    p_t &lt;- D_i |&gt;\n        dplyr::filter(treatment == 1) |&gt;\n        dplyr::pull(outcome) |&gt;\n        mean()\n    RR &lt;- p_t / p_p\n    \n    # Store results in output matrix\n    res[i, 1] &lt;- p_p\n    res[i, 2] &lt;- p_t\n    res[i, 3] &lt;- RR\n    res[i, 4] &lt;- 1 - RR\n}\n\nres &lt;- tibble::as_tibble(res)\nprint(res, n = 6)\n\n# A tibble: 199 × 4\n    p_p    p_t    RR    VE\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.544 0.0698 0.128 0.872\n2 0.490 0.196  0.400 0.600\n3 0.46  0.12   0.261 0.739\n4 0.467 0.15   0.321 0.679\n5 0.533 0.145  0.273 0.727\n6 0.341 0.125  0.367 0.633\n# … with 193 more rows\n\n\nThis gives us a resampling or bootstrap distribution with 199 values for each of the calculated values (\\(p_p\\), \\(p_t\\), the \\(\\mathrm{RR}\\), and the \\(\\mathrm{VE}\\)). We can look at those distributions. (I’ll briefly explain why we might choose 199 in a moment.)\n\nres |&gt;\n    tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = dplyr::everything()) |&gt;\n    ggplot2::ggplot() +\n    ggplot2::aes(x = value) +\n    ggplot2::geom_histogram(\n        binwidth = 0.05,\n        boundary = 0,\n        color = \"black\",\n        fill = \"gray\"\n    ) +\n    ggplot2::facet_wrap(ggplot2::vars(name)) +\n    ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(\n        breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1),\n        minor_breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.05),\n        labels = seq(0, 1, 0.1),\n        limits = c(0, 1)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we only do 199 resamples because the program I wrote is super inefficient and doing much more would take a while. (Although it is worthwhile to note that the calculation of bootstrap statistics is trivially parallelizable, so with access to sufficient resources, even a computationally expensive or poorly implemented statistic can be computed in a reasonable amount of time.)\nSo now that we have calculated a bootstrap distribution for our statistic of interest (the VE, along with its component statistics as recordkeeping), how do we estimate the CI from this distribution? In my opinion, the most intuitive way is to use the percentile method."

    "title": "Intro to Bootstrap CIs",
    "section": "Percentile method",
    "text": "Percentile method\nBefore introducing the percentile method, we should note that many people on the internet will complain and moan about how “bad” this method is, including Davison and Hinkley (who did it in their book that is older than stack exchange or whatever). People like to moan about how it is not quite right, but as Efron (bootstrap inventor and expert) and Hastie put it, the goal of bootstraps is to have wide applicability and close to perfect coverage. So this method is, in general, pretty good in a wide variety of cases. Especially if we think about all the errors that get compounded in the process of observing and analyzing real-world data, something as trivial as being a few coverage percentage points off from \\(95\\%\\) is really not something to cry about, especially when we can construct intervals for arbitrarily complicated statistics. So, let’s define the method.\nThe percentile method indeed is so simple that skepticism is natural. Whereas other bootstrap methods rely on finding normalization transformations to ensure correct confidence limits, the percentile method relies only on the existence of such a transformation, which can be unknown to us, as this method is scale-invariant. This method literally just involves calculating the closest empirical quantiles of interest to those we are interested in. Using the percentile method, a \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the VE would be \\[\\left( \\mathrm{VE}^{*}_{(B+1)(0.025)}, \\mathrm{VE}^{*}_{(B+1)(0.975)} \\right)\\]\nSo if we chose \\(B=199\\), then we would order our observed statistics, and our percentile method CI would be formed by the 5th entry in that vector and the 195th entry in that vector. For such ease of computation, \\(B = 399\\) or \\(599\\) and so on are often used to ensure the quantiles are exact. However, again, this is an example of sweating over tiny amounts of CI coverage that likely are not too important to begin with, so choosing a nice round number like \\(B = 2000\\) is often sufficient. Typically, you need at least \\(B = 1000\\), though \\(B = 10000\\) (or \\(9999\\ldots\\)) is even better and typically not even too computationally demanding on modern machines. So, for our example, our percentile CI for the VE would be calculated as follows.\n\nsort(res$VE)[c(5, 195)]\n\n[1] 0.4441367 0.9032258\n\n\nR has a lot of quantile algorithms, but we can specifically use Type 1 or 2 to get the same estimates (2 is probably better if you don’t use a \\(B\\) ending in 9’s). The others are all fairly similar though and like I said, I really don’t think being upset about the amount of difference you get between quantile algorithms really matters.\n\nquantile(res$VE, probs = c(0.025, 0.975), type = 1)\n\n     2.5%     97.5% \n0.4441367 0.9032258 \n\n\nSo, we would pair this with our empirical estimate of the VE (we could take, e.g. the mean of the bootstraps, which should always be similar to the overall estimate we already got) to get an estimated VE of \\[\\widehat{VE} = 69.57\\% \\\n\\left(95\\% \\text{ CI: } 44.41\\% \\ - \\ 90.32\\%\\right).\\] Now that is maybe not the most precise estimate of VE in the world, but based on the bootstrap percentile method, it at least seems that our vaccine is conferring some protection, with the possibility of a pretty good amount. And the CI covers our true estimate, as we would hope (although it’s important to remember that we could’ve gotten unlucky with the random sample we drew, and if our CI didn’t cover the true estimate on one experiment, that doesn’t mean the CI is flawed). Note that we would expect this CI to get smaller as \\(n\\) increases, but not as \\(B\\) increases. Increasing \\(B\\) decreases the “Monte Carlo” (MC) error, or random error introduced by the random process involved in the algorithm, but doesn’t do anything about the actual sampling error.\nOf course, like I said, some people really don’t like the percentile method. So we can instead appeal to a much more complicated method devised by Efron and some coworkers called the BCa method, and I’ll show how to automate the calculation of these CIs."

    "section": "BCa method and boot",
    "text": "BCa method and boot\nThe bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) percentile method introduces, as you might guess, new complications to reduce the bias and accelerate the convergence of the percentile bootstrap method. Davison and Hinkley agree with Efron and Hastie that this method fixes many of the issues with the basic percentile CI, and there are not really any major objections in the same way that there are for the percentile method. However, this method can be more computationally intensive and certainly more demanding to calculate, and as such I do not recommend implementing in by hand in everyday situations. The central problem here is the estimation of the acceleration parameter \\(a\\), although there is fortunately a nonparametric estimator that works well in many situations.\nSo, we will use the boot package.\n\nlibrary(boot)\n\nThe first step to getting bootstrap CIs via boot is to write a function with a specific order of arguments. The first argument passed to this function will be the original data, and the second will be a vector of indices which are sampled by the bootstrapping procedure. Additional arguments are allowed. For our problem, a function might look like this.\n\nest_VE &lt;- function(data, idx) {\n    # Sample the data indices that we should use for this sample\n    D_i &lt;- data[idx, ]\n    # Code to calculate the risk in the placebo group and the risk in the\n    # treatment group\n    p_p &lt;- mean(subset(D_i, treatment == 0)$outcome)\n    p_t &lt;- mean(subset(D_i, treatment == 1)$outcome)\n    RR &lt;- p_t / p_p\n    \n    # Return the VE\n    return(1 - RR)\n}\n\nNext, we need to create a resampling object using the boot::boot() function. I’ll comment the important arguments in the code chunk. There are many other arguments we could pass in, and the details of those are described in the manual or in Davison and Hinkley (see references). In particular, the parallel, cl, and ncpus arguments can be used for easy parallel computing.\n\nset.seed(7071234)\nVE_boot &lt;- boot::boot(\n    # First argument is the data frame\n    data = sim_dat,\n    # Second argument is the function we want to calculate on resamples\n    statistic = est_VE,\n    # R is the number of resamples, which I called B before\n    R = 9999,\n    # We want to use ordinary nonparametric bootstrap -- this is the default\n    # but I wanted to emphasize it\n    sim = \"ordinary\"\n)\n\nBecause the boot package is optimized so well, that seems like it actually took less time than my simple example earlier. If we just print the object, we can see the estimated statistic and bootstrap SE.\n\nVE_boot\n\n\nORDINARY NONPARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP\n\n\nCall:\nboot::boot(data = sim_dat, statistic = est_VE, R = 9999, sim = \"ordinary\")\n\n\nBootstrap Statistics :\n     original     bias    std. error\nt1* 0.6956522 -0.0074171   0.1223473\n\n\nWe can also plot the bootstrap distribution.\n\nplot(VE_boot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that it is nonnormal, with a long left tail. Such nonnormality indicates that the normal approximate bootstrap method (which I didn’t discuss) is not appropriate, and the BCa method is generally much better in this case.\nThere is a lot you can do with this package that I am not going to talk about and don’t really know about. But the next thing we want to do for this example is compute those BCa confidence intervals. Fortunately for us, we can actually calculate all the types of CI available with one function call. Note that we could also compute the “studentized” CI, but that requires us to specify variances for each observation.\n\nVE_ci &lt;- boot::boot.ci(\n    VE_boot, conf = 0.95,\n    type = c(\"norm\", \"basic\", \"perc\", \"bca\")\n)\nVE_ci\n\nBOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVAL CALCULATIONS\nBased on 9999 bootstrap replicates\n\nCALL : \nboot::boot.ci(boot.out = VE_boot, conf = 0.95, type = c(\"norm\", \n    \"basic\", \"perc\", \"bca\"))\n\nIntervals : \nLevel      Normal              Basic         \n95%   ( 0.4633,  0.9429 )   ( 0.4991,  0.9807 )  \n\nLevel     Percentile            BCa          \n95%   ( 0.4106,  0.8922 )   ( 0.3701,  0.8778 )  \nCalculations and Intervals on Original Scale\n\n\nWe can see that the percentile CI is quite similar to the one we got by hand, which is nice and the difference is likely attributable to random error. Notice, however, that the normal and basic intervals are shifted upwards from the percentile interval, and the BCa interval is shifted down. The BCa interval is corrected for bias, which is why it is shifted down (in Efron and Hastie they discuss why our CIs might be biased upwards to begin with). In this case, the different intervals are actually a bit different, although again I’m not sure how useful it is to fret over whether the lower limit of the CI for our VE is \\(41\\%\\) or \\(37\\%\\). (But I do admit that a range of \\(46\\%\\) to \\(37\\%\\) across methods is not ideal, though I don’t know that these two estimates would change any qualitative decisions that you might make based on the analysis. But either way the normal method is not great, and I don’t love the basic method, which is why I didn’t recommend using either of those.)\nIn general I would use the BCa limits, since they are the least controversial, technically the “best” in a specific sense, and are just as easy to calculate. And it’s important to note that all of these CIs cover our true parameter for this simulated experiment; to truly investigate the convergence and bias properties of these different CIs we would need to run many simulated experiments."

    "text": "Conclusions\nIn this tutorial, we simulated data and got confidence intervals using two different bootstrap methods for the VE from a theoretical vaccine study. We demonstrated how easy it is to obtain BCa intervals using the boot package in R.\nWe should note that bootstrapping does not solve any issues induced by having too low of a sample size – bootstrap CIs will often be just as bad as any other CIs if the sample size is quite small. If I were to keep writing this blog post, I would compute several of the other alternative CIs for the VE, like the normal approximate and whatever exact CIs people are using for that right now, I just couldn’t think of those off the top of my head and I don’t think comparing to only the normal approximate CI is useful.\nThere are some limitations to bootstrap, especially when we start using complex hierarchical models. But for simple CI calculations, nonparametric BCa bootstraps can often provide a decent CI estimate without requiring any analytical derivations."
